Score the answer on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 based on semantic correctness.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Perfect match - contains all key information from gold answer, semantically equivalent
- 0.8: Mostly correct - captures main point but may have minor differences in wording or detail
- 0.6: Partially correct - has some correct information but incomplete or missing key details
- 0.4: Somewhat related - touches on the topic but misses significant information
- 0.2: Barely related - answer is mostly incorrect but has some connection to the topic
- 0.0: Completely wrong - answer is unrelated or contradicts gold answer

The point of the question is to ask about something one user should know about the other user based on their prior conversations.

For time-related questions:
- Be generous with date formats (e.g., "May 7th" vs "7 May" should both score highly)
- Accept relative time references if they refer to the same period
- Penalize if the time period is significantly different

For factual questions:
- Focus on semantic equivalence, not exact wording
- Partial credit for partial answers
- Consider whether key entities and relationships are preserved

Question: {question}
Gold answer: {gold_answer}
Generated answer: {generated_answer}

Return JSON with:
- "score": A float between 0.0 and 1.0
- "reasoning": One sentence explaining the score
